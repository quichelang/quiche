    # Verify basic usage (Rust HashMap doesn't have __getitem__ directly accessible easily without Index trait ref issues sometimes, 
    # but we can check len or just compilation)
    # Depending on how subscript is transpiled, scores["Alice"] might work if types are inferred correctly.
    
    # For now, let's just print something to ensure it compiles and runs.
    # print(scores) # Might not be printable if Debug not derived or inferred correctly? 
    # Actually HashMap implements Debug.
    
    # Let's try to access if subscript is supported
    # val = scores["Alice"] # This requires .get() or Index trait. compiler.qrs emits a[b] as index.
    
    # NOTE: In Rust, HashMap indexing returns a value, but we might issues with references if not handled.
    # Let's just verify compilation first.
